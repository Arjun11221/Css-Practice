# Cascade Rule 
  When two rules have the same importance and specificity, the one that comes last in the CSS file is applied.

  The term "cascading" comes from the idea that styles flow down through the document tree, and when multiple style rules target the same element, they cascade over each other to determine the final style applied to that element.

# Specificity (Id, Class & Element Selector)
  Selectors with higher specificity override those with lower specificity. For example, an ID selector (#id) has higher specificity than a class selector (.class) or an element selector (element).
